This is simple factorial calculator
The factorial function gives the number of possible arrangements of a set of items of length "n"
For example, there are 4! ("four factorial") or 24 ways to arrange four items, which can be calculated as: 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720
etc.
In a set of 0 items (an empty set) there is only one way to arrange the items, therefore, 0! = 1
